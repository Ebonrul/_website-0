:computer: Lets get back to basics :computer:

Part of my commitment to doing this is doing it right.  I've since dubbed 2021 my _Year of Using Git Like a Grownup!_ and, in addition to a better organized GitHub overall, I want to make sure I showcase a full range of skills instead of just focusing on whatever assignment the day throws my way.

## What:

This is going to be a basic, single-page website. The format will be for a user profile page, the most relevant real-world use of a single page website I can think of. Drop me a line if you can think of any others.


## Why:

As I plow through my classes, it can get very easy to forget the skills that got me where I am. Skills, I am expected to display at a moments' notice. Simply put, I don't feel comfortable doing that right now and every live coding grader I've had will attest to that.

## How:

Just HTML and CSS for this one, no JavaScript. I'm noticing myself using whatever I worked with most recently for everything and that's a bad habit I don't need.
